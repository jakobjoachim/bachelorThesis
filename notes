As this Thesis is based on the Flink Framework it is important to understand how Flink works and what kind of tools it already has integreted to help develop bug free software. The Flink Framework is a processing framework simular to Apache Spark or Apache Storm.

The framework offers four levels of abstraction, the first being just the low-level building blocks which almost never have to be modified. The second level is the base API which is accessible via the java or scala libraries, followed by Flinks own declarative DSL. The last level of abstraction is SQL as a high-level language.
